%
% Function that gets a GEM with kinetic data and returns an enzyme 
% constrained model, either with individual enzyme levels or with the total
% measured protein content.
% 
% The model parameters are automatically curated (querying the BRENDA
% files) for reaching the experimental maximal growth rate on glucose
% minimal media (if it was overconstrained). Then, the average saturation 
% factor for enzymes is fitted for the same growth conditions. Finally the 
% fitted model is simulated on the same conditions and the top ten used 
% enzymes (mass-wise) are saved in a file as an output, this can be used for 
% suggesting further parameters curation (enzyme usages > 10% of the total 
% proteome).
%
% INPUT:
%   ecModel         An enzyme constrained model.
%	c_source        The name of the exchange reaction that supplies the model
%                   with carbon.
%   sigma           Average saturation factor.
%   Ptot            Total protein content [g/gDW].
%   gRate           Minimum growth rate the model should grow at [1/h]. For
%                   finding the growth reaction, GECKO will choose the
%                   non-zero coeff in the objective function.
%   modifications	List of manually changed kcats (will be skipped in the
%                   kcat flexibilization).
%
% OUTPUT:
%   ecModel_batch	The enzyme constrained model under batch conditions.
%   OptSigma        Optimized saturation factor.
