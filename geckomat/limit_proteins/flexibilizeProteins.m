% flexibilizeProteins
%   Function that takes an ecModel with proteomic constraints and, if it is
%   overconstrained with respect to the provided experimental growth rate,
%   iterates finding the top growth-limiting enzyme or enzyme complex. The
%   exchange rate upper bound for each of the identified enzyme or subunits 
%   is then set to infinity and after all iterations they are set equal to 
%   the usage value provided by an overall enzyme usage minimization 
%   simulation (subject to the provided growth rate and nutrient uptake 
%   constraints).
%
%   model           ecModel with proteomic constraints (individual enzyme
%                   levels)
%   gRate           Minimum growth rate the model should grow at [1/h]. For
%                   finding the growth reaction, GECKO will choose the
%                   non-zero coeff in the objective function.
%   c_UptakeExp     (Opt) Experimentally measured glucose uptake rate 
%                   [mmol/gDw h]
%	c_source        (Opt) The name of the exchange reaction that supplies
%                   the model with carbon.
%
%   model           ecModel with calibrated enzyme usage upper bounds
%   enzUsages       Calculated enzyme usages after final calibration 
%                   (enzyme_i demand/enzyme_i upper bound)
%   modifications   Table with all the modified values 
%                   (Protein ID/old value/Flexibilized value)
