% function T = topUsedEnzymes(fluxes,model,conditions,name,writeFile,n)
%
% Function that gets an ecModel_batch and a matrix of pFBA solution vectors
% and calculate the top ten enzyme usages for every solution (conditions)
% in a mass-wise way. The results are written in the topUsedEnzymes.txt
% file and stored in the container folder.
%
%   fluxes      cell array with pFBA solution vectors
%   model       ecGEM structure used to generate pFBA solution vectors
%   conditions  cell array of strings, with names identifying each pFBA
%               solution vector
%   name        string with model abbreviation (opt, default 'ecModel')
%   writeFile   logical, whether a file should be written at the location
%               gecko/models/'name' (opt, default true)
%   n           number of top used enzymes to be listed. (opt, default 10)
